# OpenSourceProject

CPSC254-OpenSourceProject
TEAM MEMBERS: Emilio Lopez, Francisco Bolanos, Zach Serna

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED: Python


Purpose: Our goal was to take an already existing piece of open source code and modify it
to add additional features that would support the user experience. For our project we chose
to modify a collection of arcade games that were availiable on github for all users to modify.
Our main objectives were to create a more simplified and streamlined experience for those that
simply wanted to play the games as well as add more variety to the games we found to be the most 
entertaining. We did this by adding the following features:

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED:
A major struggle for us was simply learning a new language. Most of our group had little to no 
experience with Python, so it took us some time to understand how the language worked exactly.
When modifying the car game, adding sound effects proved to be troublesome as properly 
locating the sound was difficult with an overall lack of Python experience.

MODIFICATIONS:


MENU:
To make the games easier to access for the user, we added a menu. This allows the user to simply
press a button to select the game they desire to play as opposed to typing in console commands to
access the games. 

CANNON:
We modified the cannon game to include several difficulties in the case where the original game proved
to be too easy or too hard. To add to the aesthetic of the game we have also added sound effects for
when the user fires off a cannonball as well as a sound effect for when a Game over is reached. A
Background was also added to the game as opposed to the default white background for a nicer overall
appearence.


CAR GAME:



USE OF CASE TOOLS:
To help coordinate ouur work and divide effort evenly, we used github to track our progress on the project
as well as update one another on our works so far.

GUI:
Adding a menu was our main choice of how to implement a GUI. We felt the menu would be much more accessible
to those with less experience coding and simply wanted to enjoy the games.

HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGE:
We chose to user Python for our programs.

COMMUNICATION WITH GROUP MEMBERS:
Using a combination of Github and Discord has allowed us to coordinate a lot even during the pandemic. We 
were able to meet up over Discord calls and divide up the work evenly.
